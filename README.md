# Proof-of-Concept: Autograding Feedback

![GitHub Classroom Workflow](../../workflows/GitHub%20Classroom%20Workflow/badge.svg) ![Points badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/points.svg)

Proof of Concept for improving learner feedback from [Autograding action](https://github.com/education/autograding).

The [classroom.yml](blob/main/.github/workflows/classroom.yml) workflow file has been modified so that when Autograding runs, it will generate a feedback message. That feedback message will be posted in the [Feedback pull request](pull/1) where learners can easily find it.
